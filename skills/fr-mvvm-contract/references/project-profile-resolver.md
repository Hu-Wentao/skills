# Project Profile Runtime Reference

This is runtime reference material for `fr-mvvm-contract`. It describes how a
task resolves project configuration and how the resolved instructions are used.
Architecture decisions, migration phases, and implementation work belong in
`contract-first-refactor-plan.md`.

## Resolver

Before every contract task, run:

```bash
uv run python <skill-root>/scripts/resolve.py --task <task>
```

Supported tasks are `adapt_project`, `gen_page`, `gen_component`, `validate`,
`refresh`, and `package_bff`.
The default result is a small manifest. Read `instructions.path` once for a new
`instructions_id`; reuse it for subsequent calls with the same id.

The resolver loads generic references from its own skill directory (including
an installed `.agents/skills/fr-mvvm-contract/` copy when present) and optional tracked project rules from
`.agents/skills-config/fr-mvvm-contract/`. Cache files belong under
`.agents/.cache/fr-mvvm-contract/` and are not tracked.

`skills-config` is a repository-owned sibling of `skills`. Profile rules may
add instructions and commands, but resolution must not execute arbitrary
profile code. Resolver output is deterministic for unchanged input files.

## Contract Description Language

Project config may select the language used for descriptive contract values:

```yaml
schema: fr-mvvm-contract.config.v1
profile: example
contract:
  description_language: zh-CN
tasks:
  gen_component:
    base: references/gen_component.md
```

`contract.description_language` accepts any non-empty language tag or name,
such as `zh-CN`, `English`, or `简体中文`, and defaults to `English` when
omitted. It affects Data and Business entries, Request Field Sources purpose
prose, and Notes. Stable labels, identifiers, types, HTTP methods and paths,
enum literals, code references, and authoritative source expressions remain
unchanged. The resolved language appears in the manifest and participates in
`instructions_id` generation.

## Runtime Contract Layout

Place route-owned component libraries under `lib/app/<route-segment>/`. Place
component libraries reused by multiple routes under
`lib/components/<component-name>/`. Preserve established equivalent roots in
existing projects unless an approved adaptation moves them.

Keep a Widget used only by one component private in `.v.dart`. Put a plain
Widget reused inside one route under `lib/app/<route-segment>/widgets/`; put a
plain Widget reused by multiple routes under `lib/widgets/`. Plain Widgets do
not receive a component contract, Provider, Event, or ViewModel.

`gen_component` works with one independent component library:

```text
xxx.dart
xxx.c.dart
xxx.v.dart
xxx.vm.dart
xxx.srv.dart       # optional
xxx.bff.md         # required in BFF-JSON mode
```

`xxx.dart` owns imports and part declarations. Its parts use
`part of 'xxx.dart';` and declare no imports.

`gen_page` adds an optional independent route adapter:

```text
xxx.page.dart
```

The adapter imports `xxx.dart`; it is never a part. It declares one primary
`/// Component: [XxxView]` marker and one public `XxxPage` route widget.
The marker identifies the direct view, not every nested component.

`XxxPageArgs` belongs only to `xxx.page.dart`. The adapter expands it into
ordinary named `XxxView` fields; component input wrapper classes are forbidden.
`XxxView`, Events, ViewModel, models, BFF/service artifacts, component inputs,
and contract facts belong to the component library. The component library
never references `XxxPageArgs` or imports `.page.dart`. Component interaction
uses Bloc Events only: do not add Intent or callback protocols.

## Contract Read Gate

Outside explicit contract drafting, editing, or review, read contract facts
through scripts before making module decisions:

```bash
uv run python <skill-root>/scripts/read_contract.py \
  --page-file path/to/xxx.page.dart
uv run python <skill-root>/scripts/read_contract.py \
  --component-file path/to/xxx.dart
```

The page form aggregates route facts with component facts. The component form
remains valid after deleting `.page.dart`.

## Runtime Flow

1. Read Figma, shared component and Widget catalogs, and API context. Default
   to BFF-JSON without a concrete API. Only explicit API mode may omit BFF.
2. Select `lib/app/<route-segment>/` for route-owned code or
   `lib/components/<component-name>/` for cross-route reuse.
3. Select `lib/app/<route-segment>/widgets/` for route-owned shared Widgets or
   `lib/widgets/` for cross-route shared Widgets.
4. Read `api-contract-semantics.md`; draft only the page adapter when needed,
   the component shell, and `.c.dart` with invalid semantic placeholders.
5. Classify the API, complete the Data or Business section, trace BFF request
   fields, and omit or declare BFF service ownership before DTO derivation.
6. Present the API semantics with PageArgs and Widget Tree for user approval
   unless an active goal continues.
7. Replace every pending marker, then run `validate_contract.py --phase
   contract`.
8. Read the approved contract through `read_contract.py`.
9. Prepare the rollback-protected derived file set with
   `generate_from_contract.py`, which must also generate `xxx.bff.md` in
   BFF-JSON mode.
10. When `BFF Service` is declared, implement the component/shared service,
    then `.vm.dart` and `.v.dart`. Run build_runner,
    `validate_contract.py --phase final`, and the repository analyzer before
    route registration. Omit `BFF Service` for contract-only delivery.

The generic workflow always provides `generate_bff.py`; project commands may
override its invocation but cannot turn BFF generation or stale checking into
an optional step.

After project BFF artifacts are current, resolve `package_bff`. Its generic
`package` command creates `build/bff-contracts.zip`. A project task may
override `package` and add a declarative `sync` command under
`tasks.package_bff.commands`. Resolver output never executes either command;
obtain explicit authorization before a sync mutates another repository.

```yaml
tasks:
  package_bff:
    base: references/package_bff.md
    profile: package_bff.md
    commands:
      package: uv run python .agents/skills/fr-mvvm-contract/scripts/package_bff.py --project-root . --output build/bff-contracts.zip
      sync: ./tool/sync_bff_contracts.sh build/bff-contracts.zip
```

No persistent JSON spec is part of this runtime flow.
