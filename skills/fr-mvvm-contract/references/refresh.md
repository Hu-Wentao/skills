# Generic Contract Refresh

Use this fallback when derived artifacts need to be regenerated from contract
files.

## Workflow

1. Re-read the contract Dart file and run contract-phase validation before
   refreshing derived files. This revalidates API semantics, request
   provenance, and optional service scope; refresh must not preserve a legacy
   semantically incomplete contract.
2. In BFF-JSON mode, regenerate the component-owned BFF artifact with the
   generic generator. A project profile may override the command, but may not
   make BFF delivery optional.
3. Regenerate Freezed/JSON code when models, annotations, or parts changed.
4. Run final-phase validation and the repository analyzer after refresh. When
   `BFF Service` is declared, final validation must still prove the actual
   service call and state/error recovery path.
5. When preparing project-wide backend delivery, resolve `package_bff` and run
   its `package` command after all component BFF artifacts are current. Run an
   optional project `sync` command only with explicit authorization.

## Commands

```bash
uv run python <skill-root>/scripts/validate_contract.py \
  --component-file path/to/xxx.dart --phase contract
uv run python <skill-root>/scripts/generate_bff.py \
  --component-file path/to/xxx.dart
fvm dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
uv run python <skill-root>/scripts/validate_contract.py \
  --component-file path/to/xxx.dart --phase final
fvm flutter analyze
```

Extractor preflight failure, including `fr_acdd`/analyzer incompatibility, is a
refresh failure; never silently skip BFF generation.
